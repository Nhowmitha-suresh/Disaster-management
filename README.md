# Disaster Management System – Phoenix AI

Phoenix AI is an intelligent **Disaster Management System** designed to support disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.  
The system uses **AI-powered analysis**, **real-time data processing**, and **citizen reporting** to assist authorities and emergency responders in making faster, data-driven decisions during natural and man-made disasters.

---

## Overview

Disasters require rapid coordination, accurate information, and efficient resource allocation.  
Phoenix AI provides a centralized platform that integrates **risk assessment**, **vulnerability mapping**, **resource prediction**, and **emergency response support**.

The project is built with a **Python & Flask backend** and a **dedicated frontend**, making it modular, scalable, and suitable for real-world deployment.

## Key Features

- AI-assisted disaster risk assessment
- Vulnerability mapping of affected regions
- Citizen incident reporting system
- Emergency resource prediction and allocation
- Damage assessment support
- Emergency vehicle tracking
- Evacuation route and shelter information
- AI chatbot for emergency assistance and guidance

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Frontend:** Web-based UI (Phoenix AI Frontend)  
- **AI/ML:** Risk prediction and analysis models  
- **APIs:** RESTful APIs for backend–frontend communication  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Backend (phoenix_ai_backend)

- Flask-based REST API
- Handles disaster data processing
- Performs AI-based risk and vulnerability analysis
- Manages citizen reports and emergency data
- Serves responses to the frontend application

---

## Frontend (phoenix_ai_frontend)

- User-friendly interface for citizens and authorities
- Displays disaster alerts and risk zones
- Supports reporting incidents
- Shows evacuation routes and shelter information
- Interacts with backend APIs in real time

---

## How It Works

1. Disaster-related data is collected from multiple sources
2. AI models analyze risk and vulnerability levels
3. Citizens submit reports through the frontend
4. Backend processes and aggregates data
5. Authorities receive actionable insights
6. Emergency resources and routes are optimized

---

## Use Cases

- Natural disaster response (floods, earthquakes, cyclones)
- Emergency planning and preparedness
- Smart city disaster management
- Government and municipal authorities
- NGOs and disaster relief organizations

---

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time satellite and weather data integration
- Mobile application support
- Advanced AI models for prediction accuracy
- GIS-based interactive disaster maps
- Multi-language chatbot support
- Integration with emergency services APIs
